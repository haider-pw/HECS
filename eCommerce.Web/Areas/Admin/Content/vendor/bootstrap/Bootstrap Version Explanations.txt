This theme has made slight adjustments to the typical Bootstrap 3 Grid structure. 
The css breakpoints for "md" and "lg" columns have been altered (raised) to better 
support site responsiveness at higher resolutions. Bootstrap is terrific when dealing with small 
resolutions. However, Admin UI themes tend to take up as much fullwidth screen realestate as possible.
Because of this more attention was given to providing a correct layout when dealing with resolutions 
between 1200-1920px widths. Please see theme documentation for a full explanation of changes.
